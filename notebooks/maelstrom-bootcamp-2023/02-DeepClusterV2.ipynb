    "In the first notebook, you had a first insight into xarray and the data set we're going to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ERA5 data originally have a temporal resolution of 1 hour on a $30\\,\\mathrm{km}$ grid (0.25$^\\circ$). Our data set contains data on multiple pressure levels $300, 500, 700, 850, 950\\,\\mathrm{hPa}$. Although the model provides a large variety of physical output quantities, we here though only make use of five:\n",

    "1. Latitude\n",
    "1. Longitude\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of these follows the [CF 1.6 conventions for NetCDF data](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/v1.6.0/cf-conventions.html#dimensions), which is also given in the datasets metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from your plots made in the previous notebook, the data cover the whole of Europe. As stated above, the data is given at a resolution of $\\sim 30\\,\\mathrm{km}$.\n",
    "Plotting the temperature field nicely enables you to identify and distinguish the continental oceanic areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem were trying to solve\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of Application is to identify recurring large-scale weather patterns (or regimes, _LSWRs_) over Europe and eventually investigate whether their occurrence has an effect on the power production forecast quality of ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find these patterns on a daily basis, meaning we assume that each pattern roughly occurs and lasts for at least one day.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first, we aim to develop an unsupervised clustering algorithm that is able to identify patterns in high-dimensional data: we want to make use of multiple physical quantities on multiple pressure levels over the whole of Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "One proven algorithm that allows unsupervised clustering of images is _DeepClusterV2_ (_DCv2_,see [the DCv2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882v5)), which achieves high accuracy on typical tasks in image recognition. The procedure of DCv2 is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Makes use of different data augmentation strategies (random cropping, rotation, mirroring)\n",
    "2. Feeds to images to a CNN (ResNet50) and an MLP, which has a certain output dimensionality.\n",
    "3. Clusters the images in the low-dimensional feature space that is the output of the CNN+MLP\n",
    "4. Uses the cluster assignments to run backpropagation on the CNN+MLP to adjust the weights such that similar samples get closer and closer with each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/dcv2-architecture.png\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Since DCv2 originally only works with typical RGB images (i.e. 3 input channels), we need to adjust the ResNet to allow more than 3 input channels, depending on how many pressure levels and variables per level we want to use for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sample will represent one day in our time series of ERA5 data, and we will use multiple levels and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** If we use 2 pressure levels, e.g. $500\\,\\mathrm{hPa}$ and $950\\,\\mathrm{hPa}$, and the variables $z$, $r$, and $T$, how many input channels would the ResNet require?"

    "For model training, we will be using PyTorch. For image recognition, PyTorch provides an additional packaged called `torchvision` that provides a lot of extremely helpful methods and features\n",
    "for image processing. One example is common transformations of images to achieve data augmentation. It also provides a set of so-called data loaders that allow to load common data types for\n",

    "\n",
    "As a consequence, we have to write our own data loader. Luckily, torchvision data loaders have a very lightweight abstract interface that allows to implement data loaders for any kind of data. For more details, see the [torchvision docs](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/datasets.html).\n",
    "\n",
