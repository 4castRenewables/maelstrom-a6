    "In this tutorial, you will get an insight into the data of a numerical weather model. You will learn how these are strucured and what variables they contain. To do so, we will utilize the [`xarray` Python package](https://xarray.pydata.org), which is designed for labeled, multi-dimensional data.\n",

    "## Exercise 1: Create a JupyterLab and select the required Jupyter kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the following tutorials, you will use a Jupyter kernel which has all required packages installed. A Jupyter kernel provides a software environment to run your notebooks in. For Python, a kernel may provide a set of pre-installed packages. However, it is also possible to use kernels with other software or even for other programming languages that allow interactive computing.\n",

    "1. Launch a JupyerLab on a login node via JupyterJSC and launch a terminal. Continue this notebook from there.\n",
    "1. To create a custom kernel, you have to create a config file (`kernel.json`) in a directory in the `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels` path, which Jupyter scans for custom configurations.\n",
    "   1. Create a folder namend `maelstrom-bootcamp` in the required path"
