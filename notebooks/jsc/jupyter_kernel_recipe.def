    # SLURM is configured to be only run by the SLURMUser, on JUWELS
    # this is `slurm`. This is done to handle permissions on the host
    # system and mediated by `sbatch` command etc. A singularity container,
    # by default, knows only the user that started the container. `useradd`
    # is not possible, due to read-only filesystem. A workaround is to
    # manually add entries for the `slurm` user into the container's
    # `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`. The `x` denotes that no password is needed.
    echo "slurm:x:300:300::/opt/slurm/slurm:/bin/false" >> /etc/passwd
    echo "slurm:x:300:" >> /etc/group
    # Slurm commands are not available within the container and have
    # to be made accessible through links to outside the container.
